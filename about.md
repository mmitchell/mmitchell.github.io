![Mike Mitchell](http:\/\/mmitchell.github.io\/img\/mike.png)

My name is **Mike Mitchell**, I am an electrical engineer from Purdue University where I studied embedded systems. These days most of the things I build are in software; I mainly code in **Ruby on Rails** but **Python**, **C**, **C#**, and **iOS Objective C** get in the mix from time to time. Currently I am living in San Francisco.

### Previous work

![Previous work](http:\/\/mmitchell.github.io\/img\/prev.jpg)

#### Associate Partner at DeveloperTown
Out of college I worked for a company called [DeveloperTown](http:\/\/www.developertown.com) where I picked up **Ruby on Rails**. DeveloperTown acts halfway between a consultancy and a technical co-founder for people trying to build a new tech product or service.

#### CTO of uFlavor

I left DeveloperTown to pursue my first startup called [uFlavor](http:\/\/www.uflavor.com), its product was similar to the Coke Freestyle machine but it let you modify and create your own flavors on the fly. While I was there I worked on everything from **Ruby on Rails** to **micro-dispensed fluid mixing** and **control systems**.

#### CTO of CoatChex

After uFlavor I joined [CoatChex](http:\/\/www.coatchex.com) (from abc's SharkTank!) as the CTO and took over **product development** for their **iOS** based coat checking system. I had the fortune to run their largest event to date, NYC Fashion Week, all while delivering features on location from the back of house in real time.
